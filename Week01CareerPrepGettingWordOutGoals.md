# SMART Goals Research

These are the sources I used for reasearching what a SMART goal is:

* [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals)
* [Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/smart-goal/)
* [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals)

# Resume Improvements

Below are a few things I noticed from classmates' resumes that I think I could implement to improve my own:

* A projects or accomplishments section
* A tools section that describes what programming tools I am familiar with
* A double column for sections like "skills"

# Job Posting & Evaluation

* [Junior Angular Web Developer](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6d457cbd68be75bd&hl=en)
* [Junior Software Engineer (QA)](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4014180381/?refId=6faf13f3-352b-4264-88cf-dffe08901f8c&trackingId=ZKvDM8rUQTmU9II0u6c2YA%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_archivedjobs&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_myitems_savedjobs%3BBQ6wBHSmRkebmmeF34aPig%3D%3D)
* [Software Engineer - New Grad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4015527401)

All 3 of the ones above are things that I already have applied for. I thought they were good matches because they are all seemingly entry-level, and the skills/requirements are mostly things that I feel pretty confident about.

Equivalents:
* A lot of the programming languages needed for the jobs are ones that I am already familiar with. 
* Web development is another thing I am interested in
* A lot of them call for full-stack development which is a concept I am familiar with
* A lot of them mention version control such as Git, which is another tool I am familiar with

Improvements:
* One of them mentions "Angular" This is something I could learn more about
* I could learn more about what it means to be a "full-stack" developer. 

# SMART GOALS

* Classmate 1: Brycen Williams. I would just maybe update the other projects section to maybe be a bit more specific? Maybe tell us how long it took to develop or what tools were used? (I know some things are mentioned already)

* Classmate 2: Jackson Westover. I would update the Academic Projects section. If you have a project that shows off the skills you mention, they might be good to put on there too.

* SMART goal 1 (things learned from classmates): Put at least 2 of my projets on my resume, by the end of the week 

* SMART goal 2 (things learned from job search): attain at least 1 certificate in web development before the end of the year.
