# Name

Benjamin Gundersen

# Background

I am a 23 year old computer science student at BYU-IdahJo! I knew before I even started school here that computer science is what I wanted to study. Ever since I ran the first code of my own in Junior High School, I have beem fascinated. I actually like both the hardware and software aspect of computers, but I keep the hardware aspect as more of a hobby. 

# Home

Kristiansand, Norway is my hometown! For now though, I live in Rexburg, Idaho!

# Interests

Some of my interests include football (soccer), video games, planning, programming, learning new techniques, and traveling!

# Unique

I really like fighting games in particular. Tekken and Smash Bros. are my favorites. I actually manage the 2 YouTube channels for the Rexburg area that cover the fighting game community here.

Here is an image of something I was working on over the weekend. A friend of mine's Joy-Con for her Nintendo Switch broke, so she asked me to take a look at it because she knows that I like that kinda stuff and she knows I could probably fix it.

# Resume & Cover Letter
Here is the most recent version of my [resume](documents\BenjaminGundersenResume.docx). A close friend of mine helped me rewrite it just a couple weeks ago.

Here is the most recent [cover letter](documents\BenjaminGundersenResume.docx) I used. Most of my cover letters are variations of this.

Below are a couple of ways I made my resume better and more unique:

* My friend suggested I use AI to help refine the wording for the bullets
* I used a template that worked for my friend
* I reorganized the actual material that was on there (as compared to older versions of my resume)
